            Hello! My name is Brianna and I enjoy making beautiful things on the internet.  My interest in web development and design started back in 2005 with MySpace and then blossomed into a passion 10 years later while working on custom html/css emails for Constant Contact. 
            Fast foward to today and I've had the privelage of studying full-time at General Assembly in their Software Engineering Immersive. 
            Here are a few technologies I've been loving on recently: Javascript, HTML/CSS, and React.
